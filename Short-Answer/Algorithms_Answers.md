#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
The run time of a is O(n). Since the while loop is a loop the size
of n will dictate the number of operations proportional to the size of the input.

b)
The runtime of b is polynomial aka O(n^c) as the size of n grows j is multiplied and the number of operations grows exponentially in proportion to n.

c)
The run time of c is O(n) in this case since the recursive call only is recurssing and taking 1 away from bunnies if it were used in fibonacci it would be O(2^n) but this is simply returning 2 minus the size of n in a fashion similar to a loop.
